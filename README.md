# CS 431 Database Architecture
Instructor: David Yang (david.yang@csueastbay.edu)

## Course Description:
Businesses of all kinds need to manage data. The data must be stored in a consistent way and
support access for various applications. It is almost always the case that much of the data will
be stored inside a database. This course focuses on the relational approach to solving this task.

## Course Learning Objectives:
1. Analyze the data of a problem, specifically when large amounts of data need to be
maintained. To get information out of the database, we will need to analyze how to
combine information from the different parts of the database.
2. Develop and maintain a database. Your project will gradually build up a database,
addressing the requirements, implementation.
3. Implement a database design that reflects the requirements of the data. The SQL queries
you write need to support requirements for extracting the correct information from the
database.
4. Use current database technology to implement a database. You will specifically use
Postgres, but you should be able to transition to other relational database management
systems.
